         <p>Marijuana, the most commonly used illegal drug in America, is going mainstream. It's now legal to use marijuana recreationally in eight states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington — and the District of Columbia. Pot seems poised for wider use, too: There are 21 states that now allow the possession and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>

         <p>But just how much do you know about the wacky weed and its odd effects? How exactly does marijuana provide its high, and who discovered the effects of smoking the plant in the first? Legalize The High mission is to inform and  curate the answers to these questions.</p>

          Mic check 1, 2, 1, 2, - I go by the name of DJ O'Elz. My passion is innovation. For most of my life, I was raised in Brooklyn but I was born in Panama. I'm an excellent swimmer; almost as good as a dolphin. My favorite food is lasagna. Football is my sport but I should probably stop playing tackle without equipment. I'm a Municipal bond blah blah! I'm on a journey to becoming a full stack developer and a professional DJ.

          Hey I'm Jelique, and I'm a Front End Web Developer. Besides spending my time practicing and learning to expand my skills, I enjoy various forms of literature (such as comics and movies), surfing Instagrams many hubs and anything creative: photography having most of my attention in that regard. I intend to attend university next fall semester to study business, with aim to combine that education with technology in some way. I intend to use that combination to assist in the advancement of startups and new businesses.

          I'm Carlos, I was raised in Jamaica, Queens/Sunset, Brooklyn. I love reading books and comics. My favorite sport is Hockey and I've been playing since I was 12. I'm a pricing manager for an energy firm by day and a audio engineer/sound designer/DJ by night. Music is a huge passion of mine, all types of music. I run my own record label called Whatever, we have 4 releases so far, and I also DJ a weekly party called Whatever Thursdays at the Black Rose. I just recently started learning code and want to pursue that professionally in the future. I don't have a particular preference as long as its quality stuff.
