					<p>
					Within a short amount of time, cannibis has gone from a criminal, illegalized substance: one situated and identified with various cultures and communities such as hip hop, ghetto culture and stoners, to the component of an industry that has already generated $5 billion in sales. Legal sales.
					<br><br>
					Many states have already legalized it's recreational use, something of which has lead to the breeding of legitimate businesses built around the service of it's usage. 
					<br><br>
					Through these businesses, the new ways they brand their product(s) and the increasing prevelance of cannabis, we are forced to educate ourselves on the topic and learn the facts. This will only continue to grow and will change the way we view this substance.

			There are many countries in the world where this substance has seen freedom in its usage for decades. Many forms of independent businesses and other locales such as cafes and smoke shops have long been known by and made available to residences  for the recreational usage of marijuana.
			<br><br>
			"Many of these countries are well known for their living environments, social atmospheres and overrall higher energies that excede the kinds found in America today. Such countries are known for their high safety ratings, citizen satisfaction and overall higher quality of life. These countries are less stringent with many of the rules and regulations in place here in the US.

				Known for it's cheese, chocolate and the high quality merchandise and watches that bear it's name. A country home to many beautiful landscapes, lakes and mountain ranges: it is also well known for it's neutrality. And lax weed laws. Very lax laws against weed. This site was created to deliver the facts, and thus well be honest with you: weed is not yet fully legalized in this country. However, it's minor possession has been decriminalized, and can be legally consumed in one's own privacy. We're pretty sure fine dining on cheeses and chocolates goes well together with getting high: and law enforcement wont even look twice at you if you are doing it in public.

				<h3>Spain</h3>

				<article>
					<p>
						Spanish food, culture, art and architecture. Saying that there is alot of greatness to be discovered in this country is an understandment, as it and it's people have alot to offer. Though, as far as weed is concerned: it's one of the few countries that have legitmately legalized the consumption and cultivation of weed. Similar to the fashion in which Amsterdam in the Netherlands has it's pot selling coffee shops, Spain has it's clubs. These clubs are privately owned and maintained, and essentially use legal workarounds to facillate the recreational usage of the substance. Club members cultivate and distribute to members themselves, as well as pay for the upkeep of the club through membership fees. However, as awesome as this may sound, you won't garner much luck getting into one as a/ (an unconnected) tourist.
