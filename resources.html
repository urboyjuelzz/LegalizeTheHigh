<h1>What Science Says About Marijuana</h1>
<div class="headerUnderline"></div>

	<article>
		<p>
			For Michele Leonhart, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, there is no difference between the health effects of marijuana and those of any other illegal drug. “All illegal drugs are bad for people,” she told Congress in 2012, refusing to say whether crack, methamphetamines or prescription painkillers are more addictive or physically harmful than marijuana.
			<br><br>
			Her testimony neatly illustrates the vast gap between antiquated federal law enforcement policies and the clear consensus of science that marijuana is far less harmful to human health than most other banned drugs and is less dangerous than the highly addictive but perfectly legal substances known as alcohol and tobacco. Marijuana cannot lead to a fatal overdose. There is little evidence that it causes cancer. Its addictive properties, while present, are low, and the myth that it leads users to more powerful drugs has long since been disproved.
			<br><br>
			That doesn’t mean marijuana is harmless; in fact, the potency of current strains may shock those who haven’t tried it for decades, particularly when ingested as food. It can produce a serious dependency, and constant use would interfere with job and school performance. It needs to be kept out of the hands of minors. But, on balance, its downsides are not reasons to impose criminal penalties on its possession, particularly not in a society that permits nicotine use and celebrates drinking.
			<br><br>
			Marijuana’s negative health effects are arguments for the same strong regulation that has been effective in curbing abuse of legal substances. Science and government have learned a great deal, for example, about how to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors. Mandatory underage drinking laws and effective marketing campaigns have reduced underage alcohol use to 24.8 percent in 2011, compared with 33.4 percent in 1991. Cigarette use among high school students is at its lowest point ever, largely thanks to tobacco taxes and growing municipal smoking limits. There is already some early evidence that regulation would also help combat teen marijuana use, which fell after Colorado began broadly regulating medical marijuana in 2010.
		</p>
					
	<h3>Comparing the Dangers </h3>
		<p>
			As with other recreational substances, marijuana’s health effects depend on the frequency of use, the potency and amount of marijuana consumed, and the age of the consumer. Casual use by adults poses little or no risk for healthy people. Its effects are mostly euphoric and mild, whereas alcohol turns some drinkers into barroom brawlers, domestic abusers or maniacs behind the wheel.
			<br><br>
			An independent scientific committee in Britain compared 20 drugs in 2010 for the harms they caused to individual users and to society as a whole through crime, family breakdown, absenteeism, and other social ills. Adding up all the damage, the panel estimated that alcohol was the most harmful drug, followed by heroin and crack cocaine. Marijuana ranked eighth, having slightly more than one-fourth the harm of alcohol.
			<br><br>
			Federal scientists say that the damage caused by alcohol and tobacco is higher because they are legally available; if marijuana were legally and easily obtainable, they say, the number of people suffering harm would rise. However, a 1995 study for the World Health Organization concluded that even if usage of marijuana increased to the levels of alcohol and tobacco, it would be unlikely to produce public health effects approaching those of alcohol and tobacco in Western societies.
			<br><br>
			Most of the risks of marijuana use are “small to moderate in size,” the study said. “In aggregate, they are unlikely to produce public health problems comparable in scale to those currently produced by alcohol and tobacco.”
			<br><br>
			While tobacco causes cancer, and alcohol abuse can lead to cirrhosis, no clear causal connection between marijuana and a deadly disease has been made. Experts at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the scientific arm of the federal anti-drug campaign, published a review of the adverse health effects of marijuana in June that pointed to a few disease risks but was remarkably frank in acknowledging widespread uncertainties. Though the authors believed that legalization would expose more people to health hazards, they said the link to lung cancer is “unclear,” and that it is lower than the risk of smoking tobacco.
			<br><br>
			The very heaviest users can experience symptoms of bronchitis, such as wheezing and coughing, but moderate smoking poses little risk. A 2012 study found that smoking a joint a day for seven years was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function. Experts say that marijuana increases the heart rate and the volume of blood pumped by the heart, but that poses a risk mostly to older users who already have cardiac or other health problems.
		</p>


	<h3>How Addictive Is Marijuana? </h3>
		<p>
			Marijuana isn’t addictive in the same sense as heroin, from which withdrawal is an agonizing, physical ordeal. But it can interact with pleasure centers in the brain and can create a strong sense of psychological dependence that addiction experts say can be very difficult to break. Heavy users may find they need to take larger and larger doses to get the effects they want. When they try to stop, some get withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, sleeping difficulties and anxiety that are usually described as relatively mild.
			<br><br>
			The American Society of Addiction Medicine, the largest association of physicians specializing in addiction, issued a white paper in 2012 opposing legalization because “marijuana is not a safe and harmless substance” and marijuana addiction “is a significant health problem.”
			<br><br>
			Nonetheless, that health problem is far less significant than for other substances, legal and illegal. The Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a 1999 study that 32 percent of tobacco users become dependent, as do 23 percent of heroin users, 17 percent of cocaine users, and 15 percent of alcohol drinkers. But only 9 percent of marijuana users develop a dependence.
			<br><br>
			“Although few marijuana users develop dependence, some do,” according to the study. “But they appear to be less likely to do so than users of other drugs (including alcohol and nicotine), and marijuana dependence appears to be less severe than dependence on other drugs.”
			<br><br>
			There’s no need to ban a substance that has less than a third of the addictive potential of cigarettes, but state governments can discourage heavy use through taxes and education campaigns and help provide treatment for those who wish to quit.

	<h1>The Case for Legalization</h1>
	<div class="headerUnderline"></div>

			<article>
				<h3>The drug generally isn't more harmful than alcohol or tobacco if used in moderation</h3>

				<p>
					As you'll see by reading research studies from the related links section at the bottom of the page, the studies of the harmfulness of marijuana are inconclusive and contradictory. Most doctors would agree that it's not very harmful if used in moderation. It's only when you abuse the drug that problems start to occur. But isn't abuse of almost any bad substance a problem? If you abuse alcohol, caffeine, Ephedra, cigarettes, or even pizza, health problems are sure to follow. Would you want the government limiting how much coffee you can drink or how much cheesecake you take in? Most doctors believe that marijuana is no more addictive that alcohol or tobacco.
				</p>

				<h3>Limiting the use of the drug intrudes on personal freedom</h3>

				<p>
					Even if the drug is shown to be harmful, isn't it the right of every person to choose what harms him or her? Marijuana use is generally thought of as a "victimless crime", in that only the user is being harmed. You can't legislate morality when people disagree about what's considered "moral".
				</p>

				<h3>Legalization would mean a lower price; thus, related crimes (like theft) would be reduced</h3>

				<p
					>All illegal drugs are higher in price because the production, transportation, and sale of the drugs carry heavy risks. When people develop drug habits or addictions, they must somehow come up with the money to support their cravings. Unless a person is wealthy, he or she must often resort to robbery and other crimes to generate the money needed to buy the drugs. Legalization would reduce the risks and thus reduce the prices. There would therefore be less need for the secondary crimes needed to raise money.
				</p>

				<h3>There are medical benefits such as the those for cancer patients</h3>

				<p>
					As detailed in the related links section, there are a number of medical benefits of marijuana, most notably in the treatment of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Others believe it helps in the treatment of depression. Certain states like California have brought initiatives to legalize the drug for at least medicinal purposes.
				</p>

				<h3>Street justice related to drug disputes would be reduced</h3>

				<p>
					Currently, if someone in the drug trade screws you over, there's no police to call or lawyers to litigate. You must settle disputes yourself. This often leads to cycles of retaliatory violence. Legalization would create proper means to settle disputes.
				</p>

				<h3>It could be a source of additional tax revenues</h3>

				<p>
					An enormous amount of money is raised through government taxation of alcohol, cigarettes, and other "sins". The legalization of marijuana would create another item that could be taxed. I'm sure the government would have no problem spending all that extra money.
				</p>

				<h3>Police and court resources would be freed up for more serious crimes</h3>

				<p>
					Many consider the War on Drugs an expensive failure. Resources for DEA, FBI, and border security are only the tip of the iceberg. You must add in the cost of police officers, judges, public defenders, prosecutors, juries, court reporters, prison guards, and so on. Legalization of marijuana would free up those people to concentrate on more important things like terrorism, harder drugs, rape, murder, and so on. In addition, an already overloaded civil court docket would be improved; thus, the wait time for other legitimate court cases would be reduced.
				</p>

				<h3>Drug dealers (including some terrorists) would lose most or all of their business</h3>

				<p>
					Perhaps the biggest opponents of legalizing drugs are the drug dealers themselves. They make their enormous sums of money because of the absence of competition and the monstrous street prices that come from the increased risk. Legalization would lower prices and open competition; thus, drug cartels (that might include terrorists) would lose all or some of their business.
				</p>

				<h3>The FDA or others could regulate the quality and safety of drugs</h3>

				<p>
					Many drug users become sick or die because of poorly-prepared products. After all, there is nothing to regulate what is sold and no way to sue anyone for product liability. By bringing marijuana into the legitimate business world, you can oversee production and regulate sales.
				</p>

				<h3>Like sex, alcohol, or cigarettes, marijuana is one of life's little pleasures for some people</h3>

				<p>
					All of us have our guilty pleasures. They are part of what makes life worth living. Several of these little pleasures--coffee, sex, alcohol, cigarettes, etc.--are potentially harmful if abused. Even legal substances like pizza and donuts can be harmful to a person if not consumed in moderation. Would you want to give up all these things for the rest of your life? Would you want someone else telling you what you can and can't have when it is only your body that is affected?
				</p>

				<h3>Cannabis has several industrial and commercial uses, as over 25,000 products can be made from the crop</h3>

				<p>
					Aside from recreational drug use, the plant used in making marijuana has a ton of alternative uses, including construction & thermal insulation materials, paper, geotextiles, dynamite, composites for autos, and insect repellent. As far back as 1938, Popular Mechanics deemed it the "new billion dollar crop", as over 25,000 products can be made from it. Unfortunately, the lack of legality in the U.S. and other countries has squashed the growth and development of these products. We shouldn't limit the use of such a diverse product because one use is found objectionable by some.
				</p>

				<h3>Drug busts often trap young people in a flawed system that turns them into lifelong criminals</h3>

				<p>
					Imagine an impressionable teenager who is tired of earning minimum wage, who hates living in a poor ghetto area, or who needs to save money for college. He's offered the opportunity to make some decent money simply carrying some drugs across town. Then he's busted. He's thrown in jail as part of a mandatory sentence. There, he spends his time and becomes friends with many other delinquents. He gets meaner in jail since he has to defend himself in a rough crowd. When he gets out of prison, his job and college prospects are slammed because of a felony record and/or disruption of school. This just makes the resumption of a normal crime-free life all the more difficult. Strapped for cash, he joins some of his new friends in a greater crime like robbery. Suddenly, you have someone who has started down the road of being a lifelong criminal. This story may seem farfetched, but it is all too real for some. The legalization of marijuana would remove another temptation that could lead a young impressionable individual down the wrong road.

	<h1>What Colorado Says About The Pros Of Weed Legalization</h1>
	<div class="headerUnderline"></div>

		<article>
			<h3>Crime is Down</h3>
			<p>
				Since Colorado implemented its legal recreational cannabis market, violent crime in the state has decreased by 2.2%, burglaries are down 9.5%, and overall property crimes decreased by 8.9%.
			</p>

			<h3>Taxes are Up</h3>
				<p>
					Revenue from retail cannabis sales amounted to at least $40.9 million by October 2014, with an allotted $2.5 million to increase the number of health professionals in Colorado public schools. In fact, Colorado is generating so much tax revenue from retail cannabis sales that another $30.5 million will be going straight back into the pocket of the Colorado taxpayers.
				</p>

			<h3>Arrests are Down</h3>
				<p>
					Marijuana-related arrests have dropped 84% since 2010, with legalization further deemphasizing low-level arrests for charges like simple possession. Each arrest costs the justice system approximately $300 to enforce and adjudicate, saving law enforcement upwards of $2 million in adjudication costs.
				</p>

			<h3>Traffic Fatalities are Down</h3>

				<p>
					In the first 11 months of 2014, there was a 3% drop in traffic fatalities, which marked a continued downward trend throughout 2014.
				</p>

			<h3>Employment is Up</h3>

				<p>
				Colorado’s unemployment rate has dropped, at least in part due to the 16,000 jobs that were created due to the marijuana industry.
				</p>

		<h1>Colorado Recreational Cannabis Legalization: The Cons</h1>
			<article>

				<h3>Contaminant Testing Hasn’t Happened Yet</h3>
				
				<p>
					Despite promises to the general public, Colorado’s Marijuana Enforcement Division has yet to order the testing of cannabis for contaminants, such as mold, or for potency. Since Washington ordered mandatory lab testing, more than 13% of flower and cannabis products have failed contaminant testing, yielding some serious questions about Colorado’s untested products.
				</p>

				<h3>Colorado Faces Lawsuits from Neighboring States</h3>
				
				<p>
					Talk about cranky neighbors: Nebraska and Oklahoma are suing Colorado under the premise that their border law enforcement officials have been overwhelmed by cannabis possession arrests, causing a strain on their justice system. Hmmm, you know a great way to lower marijuana arrests and costs to the justice system?
				</p>

				<h3>There are Limited Places for Legal Consumption</h3>
				<p>
					A rising issue with legalization is that recreational consumers, tourists in particular, have no place to legally consume the product they’re acquiring because it’s only legal to consume in a private residence. So far Colorado officials have issued 668 public cannabis consumption citations, a 471% increase compared to the same time last year.Perhaps more cannabis-friendly accommodations could be a solution?
				</p>

				<p>
					Even when you weigh the pros and cons of Colorado’s historic legal recreational market, cannabis appears to easily come out on top. Thank you, Colorado, for proving that the world does not collapse when cannabis is legalized.
